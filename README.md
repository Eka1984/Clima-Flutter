# Clima Flutter

## Description
Clima Flutter is a project from "The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart" by Angela Yu on Udemy. This application demonstrates how to fetch and display weather information based on the user's current location or a specified city name. The app consists of two screens: the first screen shows the current temperature and a weather recommendation based on the device's location, and the second screen allows the user to input a city name to fetch and display its weather on the first screen.

## Features
- **Current Weather**: Displays the current weather information including temperature and weather conditions based on the user's location.
- **City Search**: Allows users to enter a city name to fetch and display its weather information.
- **Weather Recommendations**: Provides a weather recommendation text based on the current temperature.
- **Location-Based Weather**: Utilizes device geolocation to show weather for the current location.
